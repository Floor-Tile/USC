  <div class="manifesto-info container">
    <ul>1.	The fourth pillar, the common city, requires shifting as many urban resources and assets as possible into common ownership.</ul>
    <ul>2.	Municipalities need to recover full control over city planning, and implement a pro-citizen, socially just approach to all urban development.</ul>
    <ul>3.	Mechanisms are required to facilitate broad and meaningful citizen input into, scrutiny over, and management of, major city decisions especially around the allocation of resources and land.</ul>
    <ul>4.	Vacant and derelict land, especially in corporate land banks, needs reallocating to community owned organisations.</ul>
    <ul>5.	Shifts in taxation from income to land is required to break up historically high levels of unequal land ownership.</ul>
    <ul>6.	The role of the local state becomes enabler and facilitator of community and citizen led initiatives that can unlock inclusion, ecological restoration and local wealth building.</ul>
    <ul>7.	Commonly owned institutions, worker owned co-operatives and complementary money systems are required to capture and recirculate value and build community wealth.</ul>
    <ul>8.	The mass release and use of data is required to empower communities to engage with, and steer, local development.</ul>
    <ul>9.	New measures and metrics based on happiness, wellbeing and sustainability are required that can shift priorities away from business as usual economic growth.</ul>
    <ul>10.	Learning and research programmes and paid work release will facilitate broad engagement with community based activities.</ul>
    <ul>11.	Citizen movements that undertake civil disobedience and direct action will play a vital role in highlighting shortcomings of established legal and democratic processes and priority areas for action.</ul>
